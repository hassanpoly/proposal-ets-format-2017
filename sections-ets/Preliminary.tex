In this chapter, we present the preliminary results. The work I have done so far. These results are focused on the three things a) relative sensitivity based emulation, b) High-level fault model for adder and multiplier\footnote{Mr. Claude thibeault performed the experiment using Tesssent }, c) Sequential circuit signature generation.
