  abstract = {A system optimization framework based on design of experiment (DOE)
	and simulation is proposed. Simulation is effective in the optimization
	of many complex systems, however, it is time consuming and tough.
	DOE can reduce the number of test cases drastically while ensuring
	input combination is of wise coverage of design space. A framework
	incorporating simulation and DOE is proposed, which provides a methodology
	to deal with optimization problem. It contains two key technologies:
	Latin hypercube design and surrogate model optimization, which are
	all detailed in paper. A problem of micro satellite system optimization
	is proposed to illustrate the correctness and effectiveness of the
	framework. The final results are listed. Also effect of each design
	variable on the system performance is analyzed.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a simulated annealing based multiobjective optimization
	algorithm that incorporates the concept of archive in order to provide
	a set of tradeoff solutions for the problem under consideration.
	To determine the acceptance probability of a new solution vis-a-vis
	the current solution, an elaborate procedure is followed that takes
	into account the domination status of the new solution with the current
	solution, as well as those in the archive. A measure of the amount
	of domination between two solutions is also used for this purpose.
	A complexity analysis of the proposed algorithm is provided. An extensive
	comparative study of the proposed algorithm with two other existing
	and well-known multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) demonstrate
	the effectiveness of the former with respect to five existing performance
	measures, and several test problems of varying degrees of difficulty.
	In particular, the proposed algorithm is found to be significantly
	superior for many objective test problems (e.g., 4, 5, 10, and 15
	objective problems), while recent studies have indicated that the
	Pareto ranking-based MOEAs perform poorly for such problems. In a
	part of the investigation, comparison of the real-coded version of
	the proposed algorithm is conducted with a very recent multiobjective
	simulated annealing algorithm, where the performance of the former
	is found to be generally superior to that of the latter.},

  abstract = {Computing a good policy in stochastic uncertain environments with
	unknown dynamics and reward model parameters is a challenging task.
	In a number of domains, ranging from space robotics to epilepsy management,
	it may be possible to have an initial training period when suboptimal
	performance is permitted. For such problems it is important to be
	able to identify when this training period is complete, and the computed
	policy can be used with high confidence in its future performance.
	A simple principled criteria for identifying when training has completed
	is when the error bounds on the value estimates of the current policy
	are sufficiently small that the optimal policy is fixed, with high
	probability. We present an upper bound on the amount of training
	data required to identify the optimal policy as a function of the
	unknown separation gap between the optimal and the next-best policy
	values. We illustrate with several small problems that by estimating
	this gap in an online manner, the number of training samples to provably
	reach optimality can be significantly lower than predicted offline
	using a Probably Approximately Correct framework that requires an
	input epsilon parameter.},

  abstract = {We provide a method, based on the theory of Markov decision processes,
	for efficient planning in stochastic domains. Goals are encoded as
	reward functions, expressing the desirability of each world state;
	the planner must find a policy (mapping from states to actions) that
	maximizes future rewards. Standard goals of achievement, as well
	as goals of maintenance and prioritized combinations of goals, can
	be specified in this way. An optimal policy can be found using existing
	methods, but these methods require time at best polynomial in the
	number of states in the domain, where the number of states is exponential
	in the number of propositions (or state variables). By using information
	about the starting state, the reward function, and the transition
	probabilities of the domain, we restrict the planner's attention
	to a set of world states that are likely to be encountered in satisfying
	the goal. Using this restricted set of states, the planner can generate
	more or less complete plans depending on the time it has available.
	
	Our approach employs several iterative refinement routines for solving
	different aspects of the decision making problem. We describe the
	meta-level control problem of deliberation scheduling, allocating
	computational resources to these routines. We provide different models
	corresponding to optimization problems that capture the different
	circumstances and computational strategies for decision making under
	time constraints. We consider precursor models in which all decision
	making is performed prior to execution and recurrent models in which
	decision making is performed in parallel with execution, accounting
	for the states observed during execution and anticipating future
	states. We describe experimental results for both the precursor and
	recurrent problems that demonstrate planning times that grow slowly
	as a function of domain size and compare their performance to other
	relevant algorithms.},

  abstract = {Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) that use non-dominated
	sorting and sharing have been criticized mainly for: (1) their O(MN3)
	computational complexity (where M is the number of objectives and
	N is the population size); (2) their non-elitism approach; and (3)
	the need to specify a sharing parameter. In this paper, we suggest
	a non-dominated sorting-based MOEA, called NSGA-II (Non-dominated
	Sorting Genetic Algorithm II), which alleviates all of the above
	three difficulties. Specifically, a fast non-dominated sorting approach
	with O(MN2) computational complexity is presented. Also, a selection
	operator is presented that creates a mating pool by combining the
	parent and offspring populations and selecting the best N solutions
	(with respect to fitness and spread). Simulation results on difficult
	test problems show that NSGA-II is able, for most problems, to find
	a much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the
	true Pareto-optimal front compared to the Pareto-archived evolution
	strategy and the strength-Pareto evolutionary algorithm - two other
	elitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse Pareto-optimal
	front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in order to
	solve constrained multi-objective problems efficiently. Simulation
	results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test problems,
	including a five-objective, seven-constraint nonlinear problem, are
	compared with another constrained multi-objective optimizer, and
	the much better performance of NSGA-II is observed},

	sequential signal processing with a wide range of applications in

	useful in dealing with difficult nonlinear and non-Gaussian problems.
	The underlying principle of the methodology is the approximation
	of relevant distributions with random measures composed of particles
	(samples from the space of the unknowns) and their associated weights.
	First, we present a brief review of particle filtering theory; and
	then we show how it can be used for resolving many problems in wireless

  abstract = {A framework for positioning, navigation, and tracking problems using
	particle filters (sequential Monte Carlo methods) is developed. It
	consists of a class of motion models and a general nonlinear measurement
	equation in position. A general algorithm is presented, which is
	parsimonious with the particle dimension. It is based on marginalization,
	enabling a Kalman filter to estimate all position derivatives, and
	the particle filter becomes low dimensional. This is of utmost importance
	for high-performance real-time applications. Automotive and airborne
	applications illustrate numerically the advantage over classical
	Kalman filter-based algorithms. Here, the use of nonlinear models
	and non-Gaussian noise is the main explanation for the improvement
	in accuracy. More specifically, we describe how the technique of
	map matching is used to match an aircraft's elevation profile to
	a digital elevation map and a car's horizontal driven path to a street
	map. In both cases, real-time implementations are available, and
	tests have shown that the accuracy in both cases is comparable with
	satellite navigation (as GPS) but with higher integrity. Based on
	simulations, we also argue how the particle filter can be used for
	positioning based on cellular phone measurements, for integrated
	navigation in aircraft, and for target tracking in aircraft and cars.
	Finally, the particle filter enables a promising solution to the
	combined task of navigation and tracking, with possible application
	to airborne hunting and collision avoidance systems in cars},

	when a long-horizon lookahead is necessary to obtain a good policy.
	Traditional POMDP planners that plan a different potential action
	for each future observation can be prohibitively expensive when planning
	many steps ahead. An efficient solution for planning far into the
	future in fully observable domains is to use temporally-extended
	sequences of actions, or "macro-actions." In this paper, we present
	a POMDP algorithm for planning under uncertainty with macro-actions
	(PUMA) that automatically constructs and evaluates open-loop macro-actions
	within forward-search planning, where the planner branches on observations
	only at the end of each macro-action. Additionally, we show how to
	incrementally refine the plan over time, resulting in an anytime
	algorithm that provably converges to an epsilon-optimal policy. In
	experiments on several large POMDP problems which require a long
	horizon lookahead, PUMA outperforms existing state-of-the art solvers.},

  abstract = {Semiconductor wafer fab operations are characterized by complex and
	reentrant production processes over many heterogeneous machine groups
	with stringent performance requirements. Efficient composition of
	good scheduling policies from combinatorial options of wafer release
	and machine dispatching rules has posed a significant challenge to
	competitive fab operations. In this paper, we design a fast simulation-based
	methodology by an innovative integration of ordinal optimization
	(OO) and design of experiments (DOEs) to efficiently select a good
	scheduling policy for fab operations. Instead of finding the exact
	performance among scheduling policies, our approach compares their
	relative orders of performance to a specified level of confidence.
	Our new approach consists of three stages: performance estimation
	model construction using DOE, policy option screening process, and
	final simulation evaluation with intelligent computing budget allocation.
	The exponential convergence of OO is integrated into all the three
	stages to significantly improve computational efficiency. Simulation
	results of applications to scheduling wafer fabrications not only
	screen out good scheduling policies but also provide insights about
	how factors such as wafer release and the dispatching of each machine
	group may affect production cycle times and smoothness under a reentrant
	process flow. Most of the OO-based DOE simulations require 2-3 orders
	of magnitude less computation time than those of a traditional approach.
	Such a high speedup enables decision makers to explore much larger
	problems. Note to Practitioners - This paper designs a fast simulation-based
	methodology to compose a good scheduling policy from various dispatching
	rules of fab operations. The methodology innovatively applies DOE
	to estimate performance of dispatching rule combinations (policies)
	over various machines groups in a fab, screens out good enough policy
	options by using OO over the performance estimation, and al- locates
	computation time intelligently to simulate potentially good options.
	Our study shows that OO-based DOE simulations require 2-3 orders
	of magnitude less computation time than those of a traditional approach.
	The high speedup enables fab managers to identify good scheduling
	policies from the many combinations of wafer release and dispatching
	rules.},

	A local search procedure is applied to the new solution to maximize

	to randomly specify weight values whenever a pair of parent solutions
	are selected. That is, each selection (i.e., the selection of two
	parent solutions) is performed by a different weight vector. Another
	characteristic feature of our algorithm is not to examine all neighborhood
	solutions of a current solution in the local search procedure. Only
	a small number of neighborhood solutions are examined to prevent
	the local search procedure from spending almost all available computation

  abstract = {Nowadays many design space exploration tools are based on Multi-Objective
	Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs). Beside the advantages of MOEAs,
	there is one important drawback as MOEAs might fail in design spaces
	containing only a few feasible solutions or as they are often afflicted
	with premature convergence, i.e., the same design points are revisited
	again and again. Exact methods, especially Pseudo Boolean solvers
	(PB solvers) seem to be a solution. However, as typical design spaces
	are multi-objective, there is a need for multi-objective PB solvers.
	In this paper, we will formalize the problem of design space exploration
	as multi-objective 0-1 ILP. We will propose (1) a heuristic approach
	based on PB solvers and (2) a complete multi-objective PB solver
	based on a backtracking algorithm that incorporates the non-dominance
	relation from multi-objective optimization and is restricted to linear
	objective functions. First results from applying our novel multi-objective
	PB solver to synthetic problems will show its effectiveness in small
	sized design spaces as well as in large design spaces only containing
	a few feasible solutions. For non-linear and large problems, the
	proposed heuristic approach is outperforming common MOEA approaches.
	Finally, a real world example from the automotive area will emphasize
	the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.},

	designed by using a platform-based approach, where a wide range of
	customizable parameters can be tuned to find the best tradeoff in
	terms of the selected figures of merit (such as energy, delay, and
	area). This optimization phase is called design space exploration
	(DSE), and it usually consists of a multiobjective optimization problem
	with multiple constraints. So far, several heuristic techniques have
	been proposed to address the DSE problem for MPSoC, but they are
	not efficient enough for managing the application-specific constraints
	and for identifying the Pareto front. In this paper, an efficient
	DSE methodology for application-specific MPSoC is proposed. The methodology
	is efficient in the sense that it is capable of finding a set of
	good candidate architecture configurations by minimizing the number
	of simulations to be executed. The methodology combines the design
	of experiments (DoEs) and response surface modeling (RSM) techniques
	for managing system-level constraints. First, the DoE phase generates
	an initial plan of experiments used to create a coarse view of the
	target design space to be explored by simulations. Then, a set of
	RSM techniques is used to refine the simulation-based exploration
	by exploiting the application-specific constraints to identify the
	maximum number of feasible solutions. To trade off the accuracy and
	efficiency of the proposed techniques, a set of experimental results
	for the customization of a symmetric shared-memory on-chip multiprocessor
	with actual workloads has been reported in this paper.},

	system-on-a-chip (SoC) architecture to find all Pareto-optimal configurations
	in a multi-objective design space. Globally, our approach uses a
	parameter dependency model of our target parameterized SoC architecture
	to extensively prune non-optimal subspaces. Locally, our approach
	applies genetic algorithms (GAs) to discover Pareto-optimal configurations
	within the remaining design points. The computed Pareto-optimal configurations
	will represent the range of performance (e.g., timing and power)
	tradeoffs that are obtainable by adjusting parameter values for a
	fixed application that is mapped on the parameterized SoC architecture.
	We have successfully applied our technique to explore Pareto-optimal
	configurations for a number of applications mapped on a parameterized
	SoC architecture},

	Moreover, it is typically crucial to process data on-line as it arrives,
	both from the point of view of storage costs as well as for rapid
	adaptation to changing signal characteristics. In this paper, we
	review both optimal and suboptimal Bayesian algorithms for nonlinear/non-Gaussian
	tracking problems, with a focus on particle filters. Particle filters
	are sequential Monte Carlo methods based on point mass (or "particle")
	representations of probability densities, which can be applied to
	any state-space model and which generalize the traditional Kalman
	filtering methods. Several variants of the particle filter such as
	SIR, ASIR, and RPF are introduced within a generic framework of the
	sequential importance sampling (SIS) algorithm. These are discussed
	and compared with the standard EKF through an illustrative example},

  abstract = {Parameterized components are becoming more commonplace in system design.
	The process of customizing parameter values for a particular application,
	called tuning, can be a challenging task for a designer. Here we
	focus on the problem of tuning a parameterized soft-core microprocessor
	to achieve the best performance on a particular application, subject
	to size constraints. We map the tuning problem to a well-established
	statistical paradigm called design of experiments (DoE), which involves
	the design of a carefully selected set of experiments and a sophisticated
	analysis that has the objective to extract the maximum amount of
	information about the effects of the input parameters on the experiment.
	We apply the DoE method to analyze the relation between input parameters
	and the performance of a soft-core microprocessor for a particular
	application, using only a small number of synthesis/execution runs.
	The information gained by the analysis in turn drives a soft-core
	tuning heuristic. We show that using DoE to sort the parameters in
	order of impact results in application speedups of 6times-17times
	versus an un-tuned base soft-core. When compared to a previous single-factor
	tuning method, the DoE-based method achieves 3times-6times application
	speedups, while requiring about the same tuning runtime. We also
	show that tuning runtime can be reduced by 40-45% by using predictive
	tuning methods already built into a DoE tool},

  abstract = {A new approach to mission operations has been flight validated on
	NASA's Deep Space One (DS1) mission that launched in October 1998.
	The beacon monitor operations technology is aimed at decreasing the
	total volume of downlinked engineering telemetry by reducing the
	frequency of downlink and the volume of data received per pass. Cost
	savings are achieved by reducing the amount of routine telemetry
	processing and analysis performed by ground staff. With beacon monitoring,
	the spacecraft will assess its own health and will transmit one of
	four subcarrier frequency tones to inform the ground how urgent it
	is to track the spacecraft for telemetry. If all conditions are nominal,
	the tone provides periodic assurance to ground personnel that the
	mission is proceeding as planned without having to receive and analyze
	downlinked telemetry. If there is a problem, the tone will indicate
	that tracking is required and the resulting telemetry will contain
	a concise summary of what has occurred since the last telemetry pass.
	The beacon technology has been proven successful on DS1 through a
	series of tone tests and data summarization experiments. This collection
	of experiments was called the DS1 Beacon Monitor Experiment or BMOX.
	There are important lessons still to be learned from this experiment
	that can be applied to future spacecraft missions},

	A robust power management technique must be able to learn the optimal

	based on model-free constrained reinforcement learning (RL). It learns
	the best power management policy that gives the minimum power consumption
	for a given performance constraint without any prior information
	of workload. Compared with existing machine learning based power
	management techniques, the RL based learning is capable of exploring
	the trade-off in the power-performance design space and converging
	to a better power management policy. Experimental results show that
	the proposed RL based power management achieves 24\% and 3\% reduction
	in power and latency respectively comparing to the existing expert
	based power management.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are often well-suited for optimization
	problems involving several, often conflicting objectives. Since 1985,
	various evolutionary approaches to multiobjective optimization have
	been developed that are capable of searching for multiple solutions
	concurrently in a single run. However, the few comparative studies
	of different methods presented up to now remain mostly qualitative
	and are often restricted to a few approaches. In this paper, four
	multiobjective EAs are compared quantitatively where an extended
	0/1 knapsack problem is taken as a basis. Furthermore, we introduce
	a new evolutionary approach to multicriteria optimization, the strength
	Pareto EA (SPEA), that combines several features of previous multiobjective
	EAs in a unique manner. It is characterized by (a) storing nondominated
	solutions externally in a second, continuously updated population,
	(b) evaluating an individual's fitness dependent on the number of
	external nondominated points that dominate it, (c) preserving population
	diversity using the Pareto dominance relationship, and (d) incorporating
	a clustering procedure in order to reduce the nondominated set without
	destroying its characteristics. The proof-of-principle results obtained
	on two artificial problems as well as a larger problem, the synthesis
	of a digital hardware-software multiprocessor system, suggest that
	SPEA can be very effective in sampling from along the entire Pareto-optimal
	front and distributing the generated solutions over the tradeoff
	surface. Moreover, SPEA clearly outperforms the other four multiobjective
	EAs on the 0/1 knapsack problem},
